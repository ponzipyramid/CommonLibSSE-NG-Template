cd CommonLibSSE-NG-Template
.\BuildRelease.bat
```

### CMAKE Options (optional)
If you want an example CMakeUserPreset to start off with you can copy the `CMakeUserPresets.json.template` -> `CMakeUserPresets.json`
#### AUTO_PLUGIN_DEPLOYMENT
* This option is default `"OFF"`
* Make sure `"AUTO_PLUGIN_DEPLOYMENT"` is set to `"ON"` in `CMakeUserPresets.json`
* Change the `"SamplePluginOutputDir"` value to match your desired outputs, if you want multiple folders you can separate them by `;` is shown in the template example

When using custom preset you can call BuildRelease.bat with an parameter to specify which preset to configure eg:
`.\BuildRelease.bat ALL-WITH-AUTO-DEPLOYMENT`

When switching between different presets you might need to remove the build folder
